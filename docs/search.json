    "text": "#Bio\nI am an undergraduate student at University of Toronto (St.George Campus), majoring in Economics with minors in Statistics and Mathematics, expanding my academic horizons within the realms of data and analysis. On campus, I am known as a pragmatist with an innovative spirit. My fascination with economics stems from a deep interest in the theories that govern our markets and a passion for applying these theories to real-world challenges. My choice of minors reflects my deep dive into the realm of data analytics, as I firmly believe in the indispensable role of precise analysis in today’s decision-making and policy formulation.\nBy studying the fundamentals of both micro and macroeconomics, I have developed critical thinking and analytical capabilities, while my training in statistics and mathematics has deepened my quantitative research skills. I regularly engage in academic competitions and research projects outside of my coursework, which has not only bolstered my practical abilities but also enabled me to collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds.\nBeyond the confines of the classroom, I actively participate in student organizations and volunteer initiatives, believing that these experiences shape a well-rounded character and foster leadership qualities. Looking ahead, I aspire to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm in the field of economic policy-making or financial analysis, contributing to the creation of a more equitable and prosperous society.\nIn my downtime, I enjoy reading history books, drawing lessons from past economic systems and societal shifts. I am also passionate about traveling, as it allows me to directly experience and understand the economic frameworks of different cultures.\nIf you are interested in my academic background or any collaborative opportunities, please feel free to reach out."
